110 -> everything is working however assembling is so slow and need to be changed
111 -> assemble is slow, now each core calculates stiffness matrix of an element
112 -> assemble works fine fixed dofs has not beed removed yet
113 -> assemble works fine it will zero all the entries in stiffness matrix related to fixed dofs
